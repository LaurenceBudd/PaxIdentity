# PaxIdentity

The PaxIdentity was created for my final year project at Brighton University, while relating to my Internship at Paxton Access Ltd.

It involved utilising Google's FaceNet to try the software to recognise the faces of myself and my colleagues. 

The result of this project was that I can run this software and analyse a video feed, either wired (webcam) or an RTSP camera. Once a person is recognised, it will attempt to identify who the person is. If the user is known and has permissions, the box around them will turn green. 

Future improvements for this project would mean that an MQTT request could be sent to a server that would enable an associated door to be unlocked.
